# Andrej Karpathy's Deep Learning Explainer Videos

[Andrej Karapthy's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy)

These videos are excellent for getting an understanding of the mechanics of a neural network and how training works. Andrej Karpathy was the primary instructor for Stanford's CS231n course on image recognition and later the Sr Director of AI at Tesla. He is great at explaining complex topics and making them easy to understand.
